Upon opening the prototype, you will be on a lock screen. Tap the fingerprint icon at the bottom to 'unlock' the phone and proceed to the home screen. From here, you can tap the search bar to view the phone's keyboard. This will appear below the taskbar raising it up so as to keep the buttons on the taskbar visible at all times. Before or after tapping the search bar you may also tap the windows button to go to the app screen. Once there, you will be able to see all apps installed on your device. You may even tap the search bar to locate a specific application. One of these is the default message app that comes with the phone. You can tap on the icon in the app screen or the icon in the taskbar to proceed to the message screen. From here you can see what an average conversation via the message app would look like. Back on the taskbar, you can also tap the gear icon to go to the settings screen. There is also a search bar here; this one similar to the one in the app screen except it is used for locating specific settings. Tapping on any of the search bars will bring up the keyboard. An example Twitter screen was also added and can be accessed by tapping the twitter icon from either the taskbar or the app screen. Once any of the icons are highlighted, tapping them again will send you back to the home screen. As a final note, all screens can be accessed in any order.

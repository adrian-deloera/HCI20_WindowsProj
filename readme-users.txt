Upon opening the prototype, you will be on a lock screen. Tap the fingerprint icon at the bottom to 'unlock' the phone and proceed to the home screen. From here, you can tap the search bar to view the phone's keyboard. This will appear below the taskbar raising it up so as to keep the buttons on the taskbar visible at all times. Before or after tapping the search bar you may also tap the windows button to go to the app screen. Once there, you will be able to see all apps installed on your device. One of these is the default message app that comes with the phone. You can tap on the icon in the app screen or the icon in the taskbar to proceed to the message screen. From here you can see what an average conversation via the message app would look like. Back on the taskbar, you can also tap the gear icon to go to the settings screen. Here you can see various example settings. Tapping on the phone icon will bring you to the contacts list. From here you can see a list of your contacts. There is a search bar at the bottom, much like the ones in the settings, app, and home screens. Tapping on any of the search bars will bring up the keyboard. An example Twitter screen was also added and can be accessed by tapping the twitter icon from either the taskbar or the app screen. Tap the compose button to see an example twitter keyboard. Still on the contact screen, you can tap the contact Chris Weaver to see a small drop down. Tap the phone icon underneath Chris Weaver to 'call' him. This will take you to the call screen where you can see a picture of the contact, the name of the contact, and the time elapsed over the course of the call. Tapping the red hang-up button at the bottom of the screen 'hangs up' and returns you to the contact screen. As a final note on the contact screen, tapping the plus button at the bottom of all saved contacts brings up a keyboard which you would use to add a new contact. Once any of the icons on the taskbar are highlighted, tapping them again will send you back to the home screen. As a final note, all screens can be accessed in any order.
